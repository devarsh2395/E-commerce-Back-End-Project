# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

The objective of the project is to develop a working Express.js API for an e-commerce website using up-to-date technologies that can rival other e-commerce companies. To accomplish this, the database credentials are configured, and a connection is established with a MySQL database using Sequelize. Following that, the API is seeded with test data and synchronized with the MySQL database.
Once set up, the API can be tested by making requests to several API routes using Insomnia Core. The API includes GET routes for categories, products, and tags, with the data displayed in a structured JSON format. Moreover, the API has POST, PUT, and DELETE routes that can generate, modify, and erase data in the database.

## User Story

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
